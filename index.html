    <p><em>Learning coding and programming <strong>(HTML, CSS and Javascript)</strong></em></p> 
    <p> I am currently looking to switch careers. After learning some coding for Microsoft Excel VBA, I found that it was really enjoyable for me. When codes did not work for whatever reason, the most fun part was trying to figure out what went wrong and trying to fix it. This got me curious about other languages and discovered Python which I learnt a little about. I did some research and decided i want to eventually become a software developer. I know HTML is essential from designing websites and is a good place to learn so I am currently learning full stack development as a start. </p></td>
